- `instruction---s3-bucket-deletion-cleanup.md`: Instructions for setting up and running the bucket cleanup scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Boto3 library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/s3-bucket-cleanup.git
    cd s3-bucket-cleanup
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries, if not installed already:
    ```sh
    pip install boto3
    ```

### Usage

1. Configure your AWS credentials:
    ```sh
    aws configure
    ```

2. Run the script that initializes all other `s3/bucket-cleanup` scripts:
    ```sh
    cd s3/bucket-cleanup/
    python launch-bucket-cleanup.py <bucket-name>
    ```

## Glossary

### A bucket key

- **Definition**: (from a bucket-level point of view) path to an object in the bucket.
    - Example:
        - `my-bucket` -- a bucket name
        - `photos/2024/vacation.jpg` -- a key, where the object is stored
        - `s3://my-bucket/photos/2024/vacation.jpg` -- the full path

### Delete Marker

- **Definition**: When versioning is enabled on a bucket, deleting an object does not actually remove its data. Instead, a delete marker is created.
    - **Purpose**: Allows recovering deleted objects if needed.

### Multipart Upload

- **Definition**: A feature in Amazon S3 that allows uploading a single object as a set of parts. Each part is uploaded independently, and the parts can be uploaded in parallel to reduce the time taken to upload large files.
    - **Potential Issues**: Such multipart uploads could fail, causing unexpected issues later on, for example, when trying to delete a bucket.
    - **Example**: Listing multipart uploads in a bucket:
        ```sh
        aws s3api list-multipart-uploads --bucket my-bucket
        ```
